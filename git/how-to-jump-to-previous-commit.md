# How to jump to previous commit

### To get out of commit you've jumped into, you need to [get out from detached HEAD state](/git/how-to-fix-head-detached-from)

```bash
git checkout d8d587
```

- `git` - base command
- `checkout` - jump to another commit
- `d8d587` - commit ID from [git log](/git/view_history_short)

group: jump

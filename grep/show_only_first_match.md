# Show only first result when searching text in files

```bash
grep -m 1 'text' *.txt | head -1
```

- `-m 1` - stop searching current file after first match
- `'text'` - text to search
- `*.txt` - search in all ```txt``` files of current dir
- `head -1` - will print only first found result (replace ```1``` with any number of results you want to have)

# Search for files not matching specific pattern

```bash
find /tmp -type f -not -name "*test*"
```

- `/tmp` - base path to search in
- `-type f` - locate only files (skip directories)
- `-not` - will revert next rule
- `-name "\*test\*"` - match all files containing ```test``` in their names (thus exclude them from results)
